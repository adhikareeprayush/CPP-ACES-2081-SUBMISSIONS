The 7 Days C++ Training Program was organized by ACES to strengthen the programming foundation of students and introduce them to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++. This training aimed to provide hands-on coding experience and practical insights into real-world applications of C++.

I thank all the participants for their active involvement and extend our gratitude to the mentors and organizing team of ACES for their efforts in making this training program a success.
